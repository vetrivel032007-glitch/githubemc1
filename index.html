        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>Perfume is a fragrant liquid made from essential oils, aromatic compounds, alcohol, and fixatives, used to give a pleasant smell to the body, clothes, or surroundings. It has been an important part of human culture since ancient times, with early civilizations like Egypt, India, and Mesopotamia using perfumes in religious rituals, personal care, and social ceremonies. Over the centuries, perfume making developed into a refined art and science, especially in France, which became the center of modern perfumery. Perfumes are created using natural ingredients such as flowers, fruits, woods, spices, and resins, as well as synthetic substances that help create long-lasting and unique fragrances. They are available in different concentrations, including perfume, eau de parfum, eau de toilette, and eau de cologne, which differ in strength and durability. A typical perfume consists of three layers of scent known as top notes, middle notes, and base notes, which release their fragrance gradually over time. Perfume is more than just a pleasant scent; it is a form of personal expression that reflects an individual’s personality, mood, and style. It can evoke memories, influence emotions, boost confidence, and leave a lasting impression on others, making it an important element of daily life and self-presentation.</p>
